title: "ARM64 on Docker"

One of the easiest ways to get started using ARM64 (also known as AARCH64)
is with Docker or Virtual Box. While setting up a Raspberry Pi with an
AArch64 OS is doable (particularly with OpenSUSE), it can be much faster
to just emulate a linux box or image on an x86 based machine. This post
assumes you already have docker installed and running.

# [Docker](#docker)

First, start a Debian command line:

``` bash
docker run -it debian /bin/bash
```

It's as simple as that.

# [Hello AArch64](#hello-aarch64)

There are two main dependencies for working with AArch64: `qemu` and
`aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`. The first emulates execution of AArch64 binaries
and the latter is a cross compiler to AArch64.

The following commands compiles and prints the classic "hello, world\n"
message: (Note, replace `vim` with your favorite editor i.e. `emacs`)

``` bash
apt-get install -y qemu-user-static gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu vim
vim hello.c
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -static hello.c -o hello
qemu-aarch64-static hello
```

Where `hello.c` is:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```

In Debian, running `qemu-aarch64-static hello` is the same as running
`./hello` for an AArch64 binary `hello`. This does not necessarily
happpen with other operating systems.

# [Examine the Binary](#examine-the-binary)

To inspect the binary, it will be easier to look at the non-statically
compiled version, so re-run gcc:

``` bash
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc hello.c -o hello
aarch64-linux-gnu-objdump -d hello > hello.dmp
vim hello.dmp
```

And inspect the `<main>:` address to see the disassembly:

``` objdump
0000000000000828 <main>:
 828:	a9bf7bfd 	stp	x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!
 82c:	910003fd 	mov	x29, sp
 830:	90000000 	adrp	x0, 0 <_init-0x658>
 834:	91238000 	add	x0, x0, #0x8e0
 838:	97ffffa6 	bl	6d0 <puts@plt>
 83c:	52800000 	mov	w0, #0x0                   	// #0
 840:	a8c17bfd 	ldp	x29, x30, [sp], #16
 844:	d65f03c0 	ret
 ```

 Another way of looking at the pre-linked assembly code is of course to
 just ask GCC for it: `aarch64-linux-gcc hello.c -S` and then open
 `hello.s`:

 ``` aarch64
	.arch armv8-a
	.file	"hello.c"
	.section	.rodata
	.align	3
.LC0:
	.string	"hello, world"
	.text
	.align	2
	.global	main
	.type	main, %function
main:
	stp	x29, x30, [sp, -16]!
	add	x29, sp, 0
	adrp	x0, .LC0
	add	x0, x0, :lo12:.LC0
	bl	puts
	mov	w0, 0
	ldp	x29, x30, [sp], 16
	ret
	.size	main, .-main
	.ident	"GCC: (Debian 6.3.0-18) 6.3.0 20170516"
	.section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
```

Examining the differences between these files can be interesting, for
example the `add` instruction below `main:` was changed to a `mov`
instruction in the actual binary.

# [Compile Dynamically-Linked Binary](#compile-dynamically-linked-binary)

Why is the `-static` flag needed for cross-compiling the AArch64 binaries?
Without it, you will see something like this message:

``` bash
root@30941edc6d88:~# ./hello
/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1: No such file or directory
```
