# Installing Qemu and Cross-Compiler

These can be installed manually ([qemu](https://www.qemu.org/download), [aarch64-linux-gnu](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/)) or by using a package manager:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install -y qemu gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

# Running an Example

Given the following C program `cross.c`:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    printf("cross compile me\n");
    return 0;
}
```

It can be cross-compiled with `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc cross.c -o cross`
and run on qemu with `qemu-aarch64 cross`. However, this produces an
error: `/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1: No such file or directory`.

# Fixing the ld-linux-aarch64.so.1 Error

The problem generated by Qemu is there is no shared object file for
aarch64:

``` bash
/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1: No such file or directory
```

And if there is, then this error will likely be encountered:

``` bash
error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

One solution is to compile statically: `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -static hello.c -o hello`
and then run `qemu-aarch64 hello`.

The other solution is to add the missing files, `/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1` and `/lib64/libc.so.6`.

Theses can be found on an AArch64 linux installation (i.e. a [Raspberry Pi 3 with OpenSUSE](https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:Raspberry_Pi3)). They are also available here:

* [Download `/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1`](/data/2018/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1)

* [Download `/lib64/libc.so.6`](/data/2018/libc.so.6)

Now the original cross-compiled program should work and produce the
following output without any errors:

```
cross compile me
```
